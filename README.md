## Hi there! üëã

---

I'm a passionate Software Developer with a focus on .NET ecosystem, building scalable web and desktop applications and developing robust backend systems. I love turning complex problems into elegant and efficient software solutions.

### üöÄ What I'm currently up to:
<!--
* **Learning/Exploring:** [Currently learning a new tech, framework, or concept, e.g., Rust, advanced machine learning techniques, Kubernetes]
* **Working on:** [Brief description of a current personal project or an interesting aspect of your professional work]
* **Contributing to:** [If applicable, mention any open-source projects you contribute to or plan to contribute to]
-->
* **Working on:** Implementation of Mobile-First Design for E&C 3D Model Review by leveraging C# and .NET. My publication for E&C small and medium companies, entitled ["Engineering and Construction: 3D Model Review and Tagging System"](https://doi.org/10.25147/ijcsr.2017.001.1.218) has served as a foundational tool within BIM-driven projects, facilitating collaborative reviews and issue tracking within these complex digital environments without spending too much cost. However, the current desktop/browser-centric nature of the system presents limitations in terms of accessibility and real-time responsiveness, particularly in dynamic construction environments. 


### üå± My Tech Stack:

Here's a glimpse of the technologies I enjoy working with:

* **Languages:** C#, JavaScript, Python, VB.NET, T-SQL, PL/SQL, HTML, CSS 
* **Frameworks/Libraries:** .NET Core/.NET, .NET Framework, ASP.NET Core, Dapper 
* **Frong-End Frameworks:** React, Angular
* **Databases:** SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, SQLite
* **Service Communication:** REST API, gRPC, GraphQL, SignalR

### üí° What drives me:

Creating innovative software solutions that improve data interoperability, information management, and work process efficiency have been my driving passion. I'm a very passionate about leveraging technology to solve IT related challenges andt to improve my project outcomes.

### ü§ù Let's connect!

I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects, sharing insights, or just having a chat about tech. Feel free to reach out to me through:

‚≠ê **Fun Fact:** I started my career in information technology in a private school with a population of two thousand plus students and I am proud to have landed a job as a full-time programmer when I was still a student and in my third year of college. It help me a lot academically and financially as a student. And, that was when I saw the importance of having proper software solutions for business operations and processes.
